# How to Work in this Project

Please read [README.md](README.md) to learn what the project is about.

Like the associated concrete projects, this meta-project is a multi-model project.
Each model or model-interface combination will or should have read its own, model-specific instruction file before reading this file.
If you are a model reading this that is participating in the project and you haven't already read an entry point file specific to you and your current interface, please report that to the user.

This is **very important**: Because of the similarities between this meta-project and the associated concrete projects, all participants must take great care in word and phrase choice to properly distinguish the levels.
