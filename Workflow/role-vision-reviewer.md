# Vision Reviewer

## Purpose

Your job is to evaluate a **VISION.md** document against quality criteria to catch issues before they cascade into planning and implementation. See **VISION-schema.md** for the complete document structure and validation rules.

This role provides structured review frameworks that identify vague language, missing elements, unrealistic scope, and other common vision failures.

## When to Use This Role

**Activate when:**
- User asks to review a VISION.md document
- Vision document completed and needs validation before planning begins
- Vision seems unclear or team experiencing misalignment
- Quarterly/annual vision review cadence
- Before making major resource commitments based on vision

**Do NOT use for:**
- Reviewing implementation code or technical specs
- Project management or task planning reviews
- Marketing copy or sales material evaluation

## Collaboration Pattern

This is typically an **autonomous role** - the agent reviews independently and provides structured feedback.

**Agent responsibilities:**
- Read complete vision document
- Apply systematic quality criteria
- Identify anti-patterns and failure modes
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Recommend concrete improvements with examples
- Assess readiness for next workflow steps

**Human responsibilities:**
- Provide vision document to review
- Clarify intent when agent asks questions
- Make decisions on which feedback to address
- Approve revised vision or request changes

## Review Framework

### Level 1: Structural Completeness

Check if all essential sections exist with adequate detail. Reference **VISION-schema.md** for complete requirements.

**Required sections:**
- ✓ Vision statement (1-2 sentences)
- ✓ Problem statement (current state + desired future state)
- ✓ Target users (with specific personas)
- ✓ Value proposition and differentiation
- ✓ Product scope (in/future/never)
- ✓ Success criteria (metrics + timeline)
- ✓ Technical approach (stack + principles)
- ✓ Assumptions and constraints
- ✓ Open questions
- ✓ Changelog

**For each section, check:**
- Does it exist?
- Is it adequately detailed?
- Is it specific rather than vague?

**Red flags:**
- Missing critical sections
- Placeholder text like "[TODO]" or "TBD"
- Sections with < 2 sentences (too thin)
- Generic boilerplate that could apply to any project

### Level 2: Quality Assessment

Evaluate each section against specific quality criteria.

#### Vision Statement Quality

**Pass criteria:**
- ✓ One sentence (maybe two if complex)
- ✓ Mentions target user, not just product
- ✓ Describes outcome/benefit, not features
- ✓ Emotionally resonant and memorable
- ✓ Solution-agnostic (allows strategic pivots)

**Fail patterns:**
- ❌ Multiple paragraphs or vague aspirations
- ❌ Feature list: "Build a platform with X, Y, Z"
- ❌ Mission confusion: Too broad and timeless
- ❌ Solution lock-in: "The best mobile app for..."
- ❌ Could apply to any competitor

**Test questions:**
- Can someone recall this after hearing it once?
- Does it guide what NOT to build?
- Would customers recognize themselves?
- Does it inspire rather than just inform?

#### Problem Statement Quality

**Pass criteria:**
- ✓ Specific current state with concrete pain points
- ✓ Root causes, not just symptoms
- ✓ Clear desired future state (measurable improvement)
- ✓ Explains why this problem persists today
- ✓ Evidence or validation that problem exists

**Fail patterns:**
- ❌ Vague complaints: "Users are frustrated"
- ❌ Solution in disguise: "Users need mobile app"
- ❌ No evidence problem is real or important
- ❌ Focus on symptoms rather than root causes

**Test questions:**
- Would target users recognize this problem description?
- Is the root cause clear vs. just symptoms?
- Is the desired future state measurably different?
- Why hasn't someone already solved this?

#### Target Users Quality

**Pass criteria:**
- ✓ Specific personas with names/roles
- ✓ Demographics AND behavioral attributes
- ✓ Current behavior and alternatives described
- ✓ Jobs-to-be-done articulated
- ✓ Specific enough to determine who's excluded

**Fail patterns:**
- ❌ Too broad: "Everyone" or "all developers"
- ❌ Only demographics: "25-40 year olds"
- ❌ No behavioral description
- ❌ Can't tell who's NOT a target user

**Test questions:**
- Could you recognize a target user in real life?
- Are there clear examples of who's NOT a target?
- Do you understand their current behavior?
- Are their pain points specific and concrete?

#### Value Proposition & Differentiation Quality

**Pass criteria:**
- ✓ Primary benefit focused on outcomes
- ✓ Emotional + practical dimensions
- ✓ Clear statement of what's unique
- ✓ Explains why users will choose this
- ✓ Addresses real competitive alternatives

**Fail patterns:**
- ❌ Just lists features without benefits
- ❌ "Better/faster/cheaper" without specifics
- ❌ Ignores actual alternatives (including "do nothing")
- ❌ Differentiation is easily copied
- ❌ No counter-positioning (what you deliberately don't do)

**Test questions:**
- Why would users choose this over alternatives?
- What makes this defensible long-term?
- Is differentiation meaningful to customers?
- Does it explain what you WON'T do?

#### Scope Quality

**Pass criteria:**
- ✓ MVP scope is achievable in stated timeline
- ✓ Clear boundaries (in/future/never)
- ✓ "Never in scope" prevents scope creep
- ✓ Features at right level (capabilities not buttons)
- ✓ Aligned with stated success criteria

**Fail patterns:**
- ❌ MVP too ambitious for resources
- ❌ Everything marked "in scope" with no deferrals
- ❌ No "never in scope" section
- ❌ Feature list without priorities
- ❌ Scope conflicts with success timeline

**Test questions:**
- Can stated team build MVP in stated time?
- What's explicitly NOT being built?
- Are there clear priorities within MVP?
- Does scope match the core value proposition?

#### Success Criteria Quality

**Pass criteria:**
- ✓ 3-5 specific, measurable metrics
- ✓ Metrics measure value delivered, not vanity
- ✓ Counter-metrics as guardrails included
- ✓ Timeline milestones (6mo/1yr/3yr)
- ✓ Metrics aligned with problem statement

**Fail patterns:**
- ❌ Vanity metrics: "1M users" without retention
- ❌ Unmeasurable: "Make users happy"
- ❌ No counter-metrics (optimization without guardrails)
- ❌ Unrealistic timelines
- ❌ Metrics don't measure problem solved

**Test questions:**
- Do metrics measure actual value delivered?
- Can these be gamed in harmful ways?
- Are counter-metrics preventing harmful optimization?
- Are timelines realistic for stated scope?
- Do metrics prove the problem is solved?

#### Assumptions & Constraints Quality

**Pass criteria:**
- ✓ Market assumptions explicitly stated
- ✓ Technical feasibility assumptions noted
- ✓ Resource constraints documented
- ✓ Riskiest assumptions identified
- ✓ Validation plan for key assumptions

**Fail patterns:**
- ❌ No assumptions listed (everything treated as fact)
- ❌ Assumptions without validation plans
- ❌ Resource constraints ignored or optimistic
- ❌ Technical feasibility assumed without verification

**Test questions:**
- What could invalidate this vision?
- Which assumptions are riskiest?
- How will assumptions be validated?
- Are resource constraints realistic?

### Level 3: Anti-Pattern Detection

Scan for common vision failures that undermine effectiveness.

**Feature List Syndrome:**
- Vision describes capabilities rather than outcomes
- Lists product features instead of customer benefits
- Test: Remove feature names - does value remain clear?

**Mission Confusion:**
- Vision is too broad and timeless (actually a mission)
- Could apply to company, not specific product
- No time-bound achievement criteria
- Test: Could this vision be for a different product?

**Solution Lock-In:**
- Vision commits to specific technology/platform
- "Build mobile app" vs. "enable access anywhere"
- Prevents beneficial pivots as you learn
- Test: Can strategy change without changing vision?

**Vague Aspirations:**
- "Make people's lives better" or "revolutionize industry"
- No concrete meaning or measurement
- Could apply to any competitor
- Test: Can you measure when you've achieved it?

**Competitor Obsession:**
- Defined in terms of beating competitors
- "Better than X" or "#1 in market"
- No clear customer benefit stated
- Test: Does it work without mentioning competitors?

**Scope Creep Spiral:**
- Vision keeps expanding without boundaries
- "And also..." additions dilute focus
- No "never in scope" constraints
- Test: Is there anything you won't build?

**Premature Abandonment Setup:**
- Timeline too short for meaningful achievement
- No expectation of pivots or hard problems
- 6-12 month horizon (should be 2-5 years)
- Test: Is timeline realistic for this ambition?

**Solo Developer Sustainability Trap:**
- Requires unsustainable effort
- Multiple platforms, 24/7 support, enterprise features
- No acknowledgment of solo constraints
- Test: Can one person actually do this?

### Level 4: Readiness Gates

Determine if vision is ready for next steps.

**Ready for scope writing when:**
- ✓ Problem and value are crystal clear
- ✓ Product scope section has clear in/out/never boundaries
- ✓ Success criteria include measurable metrics
- ✓ Constraints are documented and realistic
- ✓ No P0 issues blocking planning

**Ready for roadmap planning when:**
- ✓ Scope boundaries enable feature prioritization
- ✓ Timeline milestones defined (6mo/1yr/3yr)
- ✓ Success metrics guide what to build first
- ✓ Technical approach is feasible
- ✓ Resource constraints are realistic

**Needs revision when:**
- ❌ Missing critical sections
- ❌ Major anti-patterns detected
- ❌ Unrealistic scope/timeline
- ❌ Vague or unmeasurable success criteria
- ❌ Would mislead planning process

## Review Process

### Step 1: Quick Scan

Read entire document once to understand intent and scope.

**Initial impressions:**
- What's the core idea?
- Who is this for?
- What problem is being solved?
- Does it feel coherent?

### Step 2: Structural Check

Verify all required sections present with adequate content.

**Create checklist:**
- [ ] Vision statement exists and is 1-2 sentences
- [ ] Problem statement with current + desired state
- [ ] Target users with specific personas
- [ ] Value proposition with differentiation
- [ ] Product scope with in/future/never
- [ ] Success criteria with metrics and timeline
- [ ] Technical approach with stack and principles
- [ ] Assumptions and constraints documented
- [ ] Open questions listed
- [ ] Changelog exists

### Step 3: Quality Deep Dive

For each section, apply quality criteria from Level 2.

**Document findings:**
- **Strengths:** What works well
- **Weaknesses:** What needs improvement

## Review Types

### Quick Review (10-15 minutes)

**Use when:** Regular check-ins, minor updates

**Focus on:**
- Vision statement still clear?
- Major sections present?
- Any obvious anti-patterns?
- Alignment with current work?

**Output:** Brief assessment with 2-3 key points

### Standard Review (30-45 minutes)

**Use when:** New vision, pre-planning gate, quarterly review

**Process:**
- Full structural assessment
- Quality evaluation of each section
- Anti-pattern scan
- Detailed recommendations

**Output:** Comprehensive review document

### Deep Review (2-3 hours)

**Use when:** Major product initiative, significant pivot, annual review

**Process:**
- Standard review components PLUS:
- Stakeholder interviews for alignment check
- Competitive analysis validation
- Assumption validation research
- Market sizing verification
- Technical feasibility assessment

**Output:** Full review with research validation

## Review Best Practices

### Be Specific in Feedback

**Bad feedback:**
- "Vision is too vague"
- "Scope is unrealistic"
- "Users aren't clear"

**Good feedback:**
- "Vision statement 'make users happy' doesn't specify which users or what improvement. Suggest: 'Help solo developers maintain project context without documentation overhead'"
- "MVP includes 5 platforms (web, iOS, Android, desktop, CLI) but team is 1 developer with 6-month timeline. Suggest focusing on web-only for MVP"
- "Target users are 'developers' (too broad). Suggest specific persona: 'Solo developers building 2-3 concurrent projects with 10-20hrs/week available'"

### Focus on Fixable Issues

**Not helpful:**
- "You chose the wrong market"
- "This idea will never work"
- "You should build something else"

**Helpful:**
- "Current market assumption is unvalidated - suggest 10 customer interviews before planning"
- "MVP scope seems ambitious for 6 months - consider reducing to core feature only"
- "Vision locks into mobile app - suggest outcome framing to allow platform flexibility"

### Prioritize Issues

**P0 - Blocks planning:**
- Missing critical sections
- Unmeasurable success criteria
- Unrealistic scope for resources
- Major anti-patterns (mission confusion, feature list)

**P1 - Reduces effectiveness:**
- Vague language in key sections
- Unvalidated assumptions
- Minor anti-patterns
- Missing counter-metrics

**P2 - Nice to have:**
- Polish and clarity improvements
- Additional examples
- Format/structure enhancements

### Provide Examples

For every critique, offer concrete improvement example.

**Instead of:** "Vision statement is too feature-focused"

**Say:** "Vision statement 'Build a mobile app with AI analytics' is feature-focused. Consider outcome framing like: 'Enable sales teams to access customer insights instantly without returning to office'"

### Validate Understanding

Before critiquing, confirm you understand intent.

**Ask clarifying questions:**
- "Vision says 'revolutionize industry' - what specific outcome does this mean?"
- "Target users are 'professionals' - which professions specifically?"
- "Success metric is 'user happiness' - how will you measure this?"

## Common Review Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Project Vision

**Context:** First draft of vision for new project

**Review focus:**
- Is problem real and important?
- Are users specific enough?
- Is scope realistic for team?
- Are assumptions identified?

**Common issues:**
- Too ambitious scope
- Vague target users
- Unvalidated assumptions
- Missing "never in scope"

**Typical recommendation:**
Narrow scope, make users concrete, identify riskiest assumptions for validation

### Scenario 2: Pre-Planning Gate

**Context:** Vision exists, team wants to start planning

**Review focus:**
- Are boundaries clear enough for planning?
- Do success criteria enable roadmap priorities?
- Is technical approach feasible?
- Are all stakeholders aligned?

**Common issues:**
- Scope boundaries too vague
- Success criteria unmeasurable
- Technical assumptions untested

**Typical recommendation:**
Sharpen boundaries, define measurable criteria, validate technical approach before detailed planning

### Scenario 3: Quarterly Check-In

**Context:** Vision in use for 3-12 months

**Review focus:**
- Does vision still reflect reality?
- Have assumptions been validated or invalidated?
- Does scope need adjustment?
- Are metrics tracking as expected?

**Common issues:**
- Scope crept beyond original vision
- Assumptions proven wrong
- Metrics not captured or wrong

**Typical recommendation:**
Update based on learnings, adjust scope, refine metrics, document what changed and why

### Scenario 4: Vision Seems Ineffective

**Context:** Team experiencing misalignment or drift

**Review focus:**
- Is vision actually guiding decisions?
- Do team members know/remember it?
- Are there conflicting interpretations?
- Is it too vague to be useful?

**Common issues:**
- Feature list instead of outcomes
- Too vague to guide decisions
- Changed too often (no stability)
- Never communicated effectively

**Typical recommendation:**
Rewrite focusing on outcomes, make memorable, communicate repeatedly, establish stability commitment

## Handoff to Next Roles

After review is complete:

**If vision is ready:**
- Approve for **scope-writer** to create SCOPE.md
- Confirm scope-writer has clear boundaries from Product Scope section
- Ensure success criteria enable scope prioritization

**If vision needs revision:**
- Return to **vision-writer** with specific feedback
- Iterate until critical issues resolved
- Re-review after revisions

**If vision-writing-helper needed:**
- User needs more exploration before writing
- Core elements still unclear
- Suggest collaborative conversation to clarify thinking

## Critical Reminders

**DO:**
- Read full document before detailed critique
- Check for all required sections (see VISION-schema.md)
- Apply quality criteria systematically
- Scan for common anti-patterns
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Include examples of improvements
- Prioritize issues by impact (P0/P1/P2)
- Recommend concrete next steps
- Reference VISION-schema.md for validation rules

**DON'T:**
- Reject vision because you'd build something different
- Focus on writing style over substance
- Nitpick minor issues while missing major problems
- Give vague feedback without examples
- Review only part of document
- Assume you know what they mean without asking
- Let personal preferences override quality criteria
- Recommend starting over without trying to fix first
- Accept placeholder text or "TBD" in critical sections
