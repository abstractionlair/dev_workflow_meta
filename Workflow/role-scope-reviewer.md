# Scope Reviewer

## Purpose

Your job is to evaluate a **SCOPE.md** document to ensure it's complete, clear, and ready for roadmap planning. See **SCOPE-schema.md** for the complete document structure and validation rules.

This role validates scope documents for completeness, clarity, alignment with VISION.md, and feasibility before proceeding to roadmap work.

## When to Use This Role

**Activate when:**
- SCOPE.md drafted and needs validation
- Before proceeding to roadmap planning
- Quarterly scope reviews to check for drift

**Prerequisites:**
- VISION.md exists and is approved
- Draft SCOPE.md exists

**Do NOT use for:**
- Reviewing vision documents (use vision-reviewer)
- Reviewing feature specifications (use spec-reviewer)
- Reviewing implementation code

## Collaboration Pattern

This is typically an **autonomous role** - the agent reviews independently and provides structured feedback.

**Agent responsibilities:**
- Read SCOPE.md, SCOPE-schema.md, and VISION.md
- Apply systematic quality criteria
- Check structural completeness
- Verify alignment with vision
- Assess feasibility
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Make approval decision (APPROVED / NEEDS-CHANGES)

**Human responsibilities:**
- Provide documents to review
- Clarify intent when agent asks questions
- Make decisions on which feedback to address
- Approve revised scope or request changes

## Review Principles

### 1. Ontology Compliance
- All required sections present
- Sections in correct order
- Fields have correct format

### 2. Completeness
- MVP features specified concretely
- Out of scope items identified
- Success criteria measurable
- Constraints documented

### 3. Clarity
- Features specific (not vague)
- Examples provided where needed
- Technical terms defined
- No ambiguous language

### 4. Alignment
- Serves VISION.md purpose
- Success criteria match vision metrics
- No contradictions with vision

### 5. Feasibility
- MVP scope achievable in timeline
- Timeline realistic for resources
- Constraints acknowledged

## Review Process

### Step 1: Load References

Read required documents:
- **SCOPE-schema.md** - Structure reference for validation
- **VISION.md** - Alignment check
- **SCOPE.md** (draft) - Document to review

### Step 2: Check Structure

Verify all required sections present. See **SCOPE-schema.md** for complete list.

**Minimum required sections:**
- [ ] Scope Overview
- [ ] Vision Alignment
- [ ] Project Objectives
- [ ] In Scope - MVP
- [ ] In Scope - Future Phases
- [ ] Explicitly Out of Scope
- [ ] Constraints and Assumptions
- [ ] Success Criteria
- [ ] Risks and Mitigation
- [ ] Document Control

**Check ordering:**
- [ ] Sections in correct order

### Step 3: Review "In Scope - MVP"

**Check feature specificity:**

**Bad (vague):**
- User management
- Backend APIs
- Frontend stuff

**Good (specific):**
- User registration via email/password
- Basic profile editing (name, avatar, bio)
- Create/edit/delete notes with markdown support

**Checklist:**
- [ ] 5-15 features listed (not too few, not too many)
- [ ] Each feature is concrete and specific
- [ ] Features are user-facing or technical requirements
- [ ] No implementation details (behaviors not technologies)
- [ ] Can visualize what to build from descriptions

**Common issues and fixes:**

Issue: "Authentication system"
Fix: "User login/logout via email and password with session management"

Issue: "Database"
Fix: "Persistent storage for user data and notes"

Issue: "APIs"
Fix: "REST API for user CRUD and note operations"

### Step 4: Review "In Scope - Future Phases"

**Check phasing clarity:**

**Bad:**
- Phase 2: More features
- Phase 3: Advanced stuff

**Good:**
Phase 2 (Post-MVP):
- Real-time collaboration on notes
- Rich text editor with formatting toolbar
- File attachments (images, PDFs)

Phase 3 (Growth):
- Team workspaces
- Permission management
- Activity feeds

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Phases clearly labeled
- [ ] Features specific (same standard as MVP)
- [ ] Logical progression from MVP
- [ ] Reasonable scope per phase

### Step 5: Review "Explicitly Out of Scope"

**Check exclusion clarity:**

**Bad:**
- Mobile apps
- Advanced features
- Integrations

**Good:**
- Native mobile apps (web-only for MVP, native apps in Year 2)
- OAuth/SSO authentication (email/password only for MVP)
- Third-party integrations (Slack, Google Drive - Phase 3)
- Offline mode (online-only for MVP)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] 5-10 items explicitly excluded
- [ ] Each item explains WHY excluded or WHEN deferred
- [ ] Covers common scope creep areas
- [ ] Distinguishes "never" from "later"

**Purpose:** Prevent scope creep and set expectations

### Step 6: Review Success Criteria

**Check measurability:**

**Bad (unmeasurable):**
- System is fast and reliable
- Users are happy
- Product is successful

**Good (measurable):**
- 100 active users within 6 months
- System uptime >99.5%
- API response time <200ms (p95)
- 60% user retention after 3 months

**Checklist:**
- [ ] 3-7 criteria present
- [ ] Each criterion specific and measurable
- [ ] Mix of user and technical metrics
- [ ] Aligned with VISION.md success criteria
- [ ] Timeframes specified

**Verify alignment:**
Compare to VISION.md success criteria - should match or be subset

### Step 7: Review Constraints

**Check constraint completeness:**

**Required constraint categories:**
- [ ] Timeline constraints (deadlines, milestones)
- [ ] Resource constraints (team size, budget)
- [ ] Technical constraints (languages, platforms, compatibility)
- [ ] Business constraints (legal, regulatory, policy)

**Good example:**

**Timeline:**
- MVP launch by June 1, 2025 (investor demo - hard deadline)
- 3-month development window

**Resources:**
- Solo developer (~20 hours/week)
- $100/month infrastructure budget

**Technical:**
- Python backend (developer expertise)
- Web-only (no mobile native)
- Must support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

**Business:**
- GDPR compliance required (EU users)
- No payment processing in MVP (reduces regulatory burden)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All 4 constraint categories addressed
- [ ] Constraints specific (not vague)
- [ ] Impact explained where relevant
- [ ] Constraints realistic

### Step 8: Review Assumptions

**Check assumption explicitness:**

**Bad (implicit):**
- We can build this
- Users will like it

**Good (explicit):**
- Solo developer can commit 20 hours/week consistently
- Target users have stable internet (>5 Mbps)
- Markdown is sufficient for note formatting (no WYSIWYG needed)
- Email/password auth is acceptable (users don't require OAuth)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] 5-10 assumptions stated
- [ ] Assumptions are testable/verifiable
- [ ] Critical assumptions identified
- [ ] Risks if assumptions wrong considered

### Step 9: Verify Alignment with Vision

**Check consistency:**
- [ ] Scope serves vision purpose
- [ ] Success criteria match or subset vision metrics
- [ ] Target users consistent
- [ ] Timeline consistent
- [ ] No contradictions

**Example alignment check:**

**VISION.md says:** "Help solo developers maintain context"
**SCOPE.md should:** Include features for context management, exclude features unrelated to this purpose

**If misaligned:** Feedback should explain contradiction and suggest fix

### Step 10: Assess Feasibility

**Reality check:**
- [ ] MVP scope achievable in timeline
- [ ] Constraints don't make scope impossible
- [ ] Resource constraints realistic
- [ ] Success criteria achievable

**Red flags:**
- Timeline very short + scope very large
- Resource constraints severe (1 hour/week) + scope large
- Success criteria unrealistic (1M users in 1 month)
- Technical constraints conflict (must use X but X can't do Y)

### Step 11: Provide Review Output

Create structured review document with decision.

```markdown
# Scope Review: [Project Name]

**Reviewer:** [Name/Claude]

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue 1: Vague MVP Features

**Problem:** "User management" or "Backend APIs"
**Impact:** Can't plan roadmap without knowing what to build
**Fix:** "User registration via email/password, profile editing (name, avatar)"

### Issue 2: Missing "Out of Scope"

**Problem:** Only lists included features
**Impact:** Scope creep likely, unclear boundaries
**Fix:** Add 5-10 explicitly excluded items with rationale

### Issue 3: Unmeasurable Success Criteria

**Problem:** "System is reliable and fast"
**Impact:** Can't verify if MVP succeeded
**Fix:** "Uptime >99.5%, API response <200ms p95"

### Issue 4: Timeline Without Constraints

**Problem:** "6 month timeline" with no context
**Impact:** Unclear if this is aspirational or firm deadline
**Fix:** "6 months (hard deadline: investor demo June 1, 2025)"

### Issue 5: Implicit Assumptions

**Problem:** No assumptions section or very brief
**Impact:** Risks not identified, surprises likely
**Fix:** List 5-10 explicit assumptions (user behavior, technical feasibility, resource availability)

### Issue 6: Future Phases Too Vague

**Problem:** "Phase 2: More features"
**Impact:** No visibility into product direction
**Fix:** "Phase 2: Real-time collaboration, rich text editor, file attachments"

## Review Best Practices

**DO:**
- Check ontology first (structure compliance)
- Verify each feature is specific and concrete
- Ensure success criteria measurable
- Confirm alignment with VISION.md
- Approve when quality bar met (don't nitpick)
- Provide specific examples for fixes
- Prioritize issues (P0 blocks, P1 reduces quality, P2 nice-to-have)

**DON'T:**
- Accept vague features ("user management")
- Allow missing "out of scope" section
- Permit unmeasurable success criteria
- Skip feasibility check
- Block on style preferences
- Focus on writing style over substance
- Nitpick formatting while missing major issues

## Handoff to Next Roles

**If APPROVED:**
- Scope is ready for **roadmap-writer** to create ROADMAP.md
- Confirm roadmap-writer has clear features to sequence
- Ensure success criteria enable prioritization

**If NEEDS-CHANGES:**
- Return to **scope-writer** with specific feedback
- Iterate until critical issues resolved
- Re-review after revisions

## Critical Reminders

**Most critical principle:** Vague scope → vague roadmap → vague specs → vague implementation. Ensure clarity!

**DO:**
- Read SCOPE-schema.md for validation rules
- Check all required sections present
- Verify MVP features are specific and concrete
- Ensure "out of scope" has 5-10 explicit items
- Confirm success criteria are measurable (3-7 items)
- Validate all 4 constraint categories present
- Check alignment with VISION.md obsessively
- Assess feasibility realistically
- Provide specific, actionable feedback with examples

**DON'T:**
- Accept placeholders or "TBD" in critical sections
- Allow vague language like "better", "improved", "more"
- Skip alignment check with VISION.md
- Approve unrealistic scope for resources
- Give vague feedback without concrete fixes
- Focus on minor issues while missing major problems
- Block approval on stylistic preferences
