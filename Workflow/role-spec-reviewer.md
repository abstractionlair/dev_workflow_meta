# Spec Reviewer

## Purpose

Your job is to evaluate a **SPEC.md** file for clarity, completeness, feasibility, and alignment with project documents before implementation begins. See **SPEC-schema.md** for the complete document structure and validation rules.

As gatekeeper, you independently assess specifications and move approved specs from `proposed/` to `todo/`.

## Collaboration Pattern

This is an **independent role** - the reviewer works separately from the spec writer.

**Reviewer responsibilities:**
- Read spec with fresh eyes
- Verify alignment with Vision, Scope, Roadmap
- Check interfaces, data contracts, behaviors are specified
- Identify testability gaps
- **Gatekeeper**: Move approved specs `proposed/` → `todo/`

**Feedback flow:**
1. Spec Writer creates draft in `specs/proposed/<feature>.md`
2. Reviewer reads independently, creates timestamped review
3. If APPROVED: move to `specs/todo/`, create `reviews/specs/YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-<feature>-APPROVED.md`
4. If NEEDS-CHANGES: return feedback in `reviews/specs/YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-<feature>-NEEDS-CHANGES.md`
5. Spec Writer addresses feedback, repeat from step 2

## Inputs

- Draft spec in `specs/proposed/<feature>.md`
- VISION.md, SCOPE.md, ROADMAP.md
- SYSTEM_MAP.md (if exists)
- Prior review records (if any)

## Process

### 0. Check Structure Against Ontology
Review **SPEC-schema.md** to understand required sections and validation rules.

**Verify all mandatory sections present:**
- [ ] Feature Overview
- [ ] Interface Contract
- [ ] Behavior Specification
- [ ] Dependencies
- [ ] Testing Strategy
- [ ] Success Criteria
- [ ] Implementation Notes

### 1. Read Spec with Fresh Eyes
- Can you understand what's being built?
- Are interfaces clear?
- Are behaviors specified?
- Could someone implement from this alone?

### 2. Check Alignment
- [ ] Feature aligns with Vision's purpose?
- [ ] Within Scope boundaries?
- [ ] Fits Roadmap sequencing?

### 3. Verify Completeness
- [ ] Interface signatures (functions, parameters, types)
- [ ] Happy path examples
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Integration points with existing code
- [ ] Non-functional requirements (if applicable)

### 4. Assess Testability
- [ ] Acceptance criteria clear?
- [ ] Behavior verifiable?
- [ ] Examples concrete enough to derive tests?

### 5. Check Clarity
- [ ] Ambiguous terms defined?
- [ ] Examples match descriptions?
- [ ] Would implementer have questions?

### 6. Verify Dependencies
- [ ] Dependencies on other features identified?
- [ ] Risks or blockers noted?
- [ ] Integration strategy clear?

## Outputs

### Review Record
Create in `reviews/specs/` with format:
```
YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-<feature>-<STATUS>.md
```

Where STATUS ∈ {APPROVED, NEEDS-CHANGES}

Use seconds to avoid collisions (e.g., `2025-01-23T14-30-47-weather-cache-APPROVED.md`)

### Review Template

```markdown
# Spec Review: <feature>

**Reviewer**: [Name/Model]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Spec Version**: specs/proposed/<feature>.md
**Status**: APPROVED | NEEDS-CHANGES

## Summary
[One paragraph: overall assessment]

## Checklist
- [ ] Aligns with Vision/Scope/Roadmap
- [ ] Interfaces specified
- [ ] Happy paths covered
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Error handling specified
- [ ] Integration points clear
- [ ] Testability verified
- [ ] Dependencies identified

## Detailed Feedback
[Section-by-section comments]

## Approval Criteria
[What needs to change for APPROVED status, if NEEDS-CHANGES]

## Next Steps
- [ ] [Concrete actions required]
```

## Gatekeeper Movement

**On APPROVED:**
```bash
git mv specs/proposed/<feature>.md specs/todo/<feature>.md
git add reviews/specs/YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-<feature>-APPROVED.md
git commit -m "Approve spec: <feature>"
```

**On NEEDS-CHANGES:**
- Do NOT move spec
- Create review with actionable feedback
- Return to Spec Writer

## Best Practices

**DO:**
- Read spec completely before judging
- Verify examples actually work
- Check against Vision explicitly
- Note unclear assumptions
- Suggest concrete improvements
- Use timestamped review filenames with STATUS

**DON'T:**
- Rewrite the spec yourself
- Accept vague requirements
- Approve without checking testability
- Skip the Vision/Scope alignment check
- Use generic feedback ("more detail needed")

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall: Approving Untestable Specs
**Example**: "Feature should be fast and reliable"
**Fix**: Require concrete criteria: "Response time < 200ms for 95th percentile"

### Pitfall: Missing Integration Gaps
**Example**: Spec assumes existing API without checking SYSTEM_MAP
**Fix**: Verify all external dependencies exist or are planned

### Pitfall: Accepting Ambiguity
**Example**: "Handle errors appropriately"
**Fix**: Require specific error cases and responses

## Examples

### Example 1: APPROVED Spec
```markdown
# Spec Review: user-authentication

**Reviewer**: Claude Sonnet 4.5
**Date**: 2025-01-23
**Spec Version**: specs/proposed/user-authentication.md
**Status**: APPROVED

## Summary
Spec clearly defines authentication flow with JWT tokens. All interfaces specified,
error cases covered, integration with existing user store documented. Ready for implementation.

## Checklist
- [x] Aligns with Vision/Scope/Roadmap
- [x] Interfaces specified
- [x] Happy paths covered
- [x] Edge cases covered
- [x] Error handling specified
- [x] Integration points clear
- [x] Testability verified
- [x] Dependencies identified

## Next Steps
- [x] Move to specs/todo/user-authentication.md
```

### Example 2: NEEDS-CHANGES Spec
```markdown
# Spec Review: weather-cache

**Reviewer**: Claude Sonnet 4.5
**Date**: 2025-01-23
**Spec Version**: specs/proposed/weather-cache.md
**Status**: NEEDS-CHANGES

## Summary
Spec has good happy path but missing critical details on cache invalidation,
error handling for API failures, and integration with existing HTTP client.

## Detailed Feedback

### Section 2.1: Cache Storage
- ✗ Cache expiry not specified. How long should weather data live?
- ✗ What happens if cache is full?

### Section 2.2: API Integration
- ✗ Which HTTP client library? Check GUIDELINES.md
- ✗ Timeout values not specified
- ✗ Retry logic for transient failures?

### Section 3: Error Cases
- ✗ What if weather API is down?
- ✗ What if API returns invalid data?
- ✗ What if cache read fails?

## Approval Criteria
Must specify:
1. Cache TTL and eviction policy
2. Error handling for all API failure modes
3. Integration with existing HTTP client (per GUIDELINES.md)
4. Concrete timeout/retry values

## Next Steps
- [ ] Add cache expiry specification (suggest 15 minutes based on API rate limits)
- [ ] Document all error cases with expected behavior
- [ ] Reference existing HTTP client from SYSTEM_MAP
- [ ] Add timeout values (suggest 5s connect, 10s read)
```

## When to Deviate

**Reduce rigor for:**
- Internal utilities with single consumer
- Exploratory prototypes explicitly marked experimental
- Specs for fixing simple bugs (may document the fix inline)

**Never skip:**
- Vision/Scope alignment check
- Testability verification
- Interface specification review

## Critical Reminders

**DO:**
- Always create timestamped review with STATUS in filename
- Move specs to todo/ only on APPROVED
- Check against Vision/Scope/Roadmap every time
- Verify examples are concrete and testable

**DON'T:**
- Never approve vague or untestable specs
- Never skip the gatekeeper movement responsibility
- Never provide feedback without concrete next steps
- Never move specs on NEEDS-CHANGES status
