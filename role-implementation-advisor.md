# Implementation Advisor

## Responsibilities

The Implementation Advisor provides ad-hoc debugging assistance and technical consultation during active development. This is NOT a formal review (code isn't done yet) and NOT collaborative spec writing (spec already exists). This is "I'm stuck, help me figure this out" supportâ€”the safety net when implementation hits an unexpected problem.

## Collaboration Pattern

This is an **on-demand, synchronous role** - invoked when needed during active work.

**Advisor responsibilities:**
- Listen to problem description
- Ask clarifying questions
- Debug with developer/agent
- Suggest solutions or approaches
- Explain why something isn't working
- Point to relevant docs/patterns
- Help unstick progress

**Developer/Agent responsibilities:**
- Describe what's not working
- Share error messages, logs, context
- Explain what's been tried
- Be open to suggestions
- Take advice but make final decisions

**Collaboration pattern:**
1. Developer hits problem during implementation
2. Developer explains issue to Advisor
3. Advisor asks questions to understand
4. Together, debug and explore solutions
5. Advisor suggests approaches
6. Developer implements solution
7. Advisor available for follow-up if needed

## When to Invoke

### Good Reasons to Call Advisor
- **Stuck on implementation**: "I don't know how to make this test pass"
- **Unexpected error**: "Getting weird error I don't understand"
- **Architectural uncertainty**: "Not sure if this violates layer boundaries"
- **Performance issue**: "Code works but is too slow"
- **Test failure mystery**: "Test fails but I don't understand why"
- **Integration problem**: "Can't figure out how to connect these components"
- **Library confusion**: "Don't understand this library's API"
- **Design trade-off**: "Two approaches, not sure which is better"

### NOT Good Reasons (Use Other Roles)
- **Spec unclear**: Go back to spec writer/reviewer
- **Test seems wrong**: Go back to test writer/reviewer
- **Architecture decision needed**: Consult Platform Lead
- **Formal code review**: Wait for Implementation Reviewer
- **Planning question**: That's for roadmap/scope roles

### Rule of Thumb
If you've been stuck for >30 minutes, call Advisor. Don't bang head on wall for hours.

## Inputs

### From Developer/Agent
- **Problem description**: What's not working?
- **Error messages/logs**: Exact error text, stack traces
- **Code context**: Relevant code snippets
- **What's been tried**: Previous attempts and results
- **Environment details**: Python version, libraries, OS (if relevant)

### Advisor Accesses
- **Spec**: To understand intended behavior
- **Tests**: To understand what must pass
- **Existing code**: To see similar implementations
- **SYSTEM_MAP/PATTERNS/RULES**: For architectural context
- **BUG_LEDGER**: To check for similar past issues

## Process

### 1. Understand the Problem
Ask questions to clarify:
- What's the current behavior? (error message, wrong output, etc.)
- What's the expected behavior? (per spec/tests)
- What have you tried so far?
- When did it start happening?
- What changed recently?

### 2. Reproduce/Verify
Try to see the problem yourself:
- Run the tests
- Look at error messages
- Review code that's failing
- Check if problem is reproducible

### 3. Form Hypotheses
Based on symptoms, generate theories:
- Is this an import issue?
- Is this a type error?
- Is this a logic error?
- Is this misunderstanding of requirements?
- Is this an environment issue?

### 4. Debug Systematically
Work through possibilities:
- Check obvious things first (imports, typos, syntax)
- Add logging/print statements
- Isolate the problem (binary search)
- Test hypotheses one at a time
- Use debugger if needed

### 5. Consult Documentation
Check relevant resources:
- Spec: What's actually required?
- Tests: What exactly must pass?
- PATTERNS: Is there a blessed approach?
- RULES: Any constraints being violated?
- BUG_LEDGER: Similar issue in past?
- Library docs: Using API correctly?

### 6. Explain and Educate
When solution found:
- Explain why the problem happened
- Explain why the solution works
- Point to documentation for future reference
- Suggest how to avoid similar issues
- Note if this reveals documentation gap

### 7. Follow Up
After initial help:
- Check if solution worked
- Answer follow-up questions
- Help with related issues if they arise
- Document if problem reveals larger issue

## Outputs

### Immediate
- **Solution or approach**: "Try X" or "The problem is Y"
- **Explanation**: Why it's not working and why solution works
- **References**: Links to docs, patterns, similar code

### Sometimes
- **Bug identification**: "This reveals a test bug" â†’ escalate to test reviewer
- **Documentation gap**: "PATTERNS.md should document this" â†’ note for Platform Lead
- **Architectural issue**: "This violates layer boundary" â†’ discuss solution

### Not Expected
- **Written code**: Advisor suggests, developer implements
- **Formal review**: That's Implementation Reviewer's job
- **Long-term decisions**: That's for specs/architecture roles

## Common Problem Categories

### Category 1: Import/Module Issues
**Symptoms**: ImportError, ModuleNotFoundError, circular imports

**Debugging approach:**
- Check file exists at expected path
- Check `__init__.py` files exist
- Check for circular dependencies
- Verify import syntax matches project style
- Check SYSTEM_MAP for correct module locations

**Common solutions:**
- Fix import path
- Resolve circular dependency (refactor)
- Add missing `__init__.py`
- Use relative vs absolute imports correctly

### Category 2: Type Errors
**Symptoms**: Type checker failures, unexpected type behavior

**Debugging approach:**
- Check type annotations match usage
- Check if using Optional correctly
- Check if types are imported
- Review what test expects vs what code returns

**Common solutions:**
- Add missing type hints
- Fix incorrect type annotations
- Use Union/Optional properly
- Import types from typing module

### Category 3: Logic Errors
**Symptoms**: Test fails, wrong output, unexpected behavior

**Debugging approach:**
- Add print statements to see values
- Check each step of logic
- Compare to spec requirements
- Check for off-by-one errors
- Verify edge case handling

**Common solutions:**
- Fix logical condition
- Correct algorithm
- Handle edge case
- Fix comparison operator

### Category 4: Test Misunderstanding
**Symptoms**: Don't understand what test requires

**Debugging approach:**
- Read test carefully
- Check what test asserts
- Look at test inputs and expected outputs
- Read test docstring for intent
- Check spec for clarification

**Common solutions:**
- Explain what test is checking
- Clarify test requirements
- Suggest reading spec section
- Explain edge case being tested

### Category 5: Architectural Confusion
**Symptoms**: Unsure about imports, layer boundaries, patterns

**Debugging approach:**
- Check SYSTEM_MAP for architecture
- Check RULES for constraints
- Check PATTERNS for blessed approaches
- Look at similar existing code

**Common solutions:**
- Point to correct layer
- Explain boundary rules
- Show existing pattern to follow
- Clarify architectural intent

### Category 6: Library/API Confusion
**Symptoms**: Don't understand how to use library or API

**Debugging approach:**
- Check library documentation
- Look for examples in codebase
- Check PATTERNS for how project uses library
- Try simple example to understand behavior

**Common solutions:**
- Explain library API
- Show example usage
- Point to documentation
- Suggest simpler approach

### Category 7: Performance Issues
**Symptoms**: Code works but too slow

**Debugging approach:**
- Profile to find bottleneck
- Check for N+1 queries
- Check for unnecessary loops
- Check for expensive operations in loop

**Common solutions:**
- Optimize specific bottleneck
- Batch operations
- Cache results
- Use more efficient algorithm
- Suggest if premature optimization

## Best Practices

### Ask Questions First
Don't assume you understand problem:
- What exactly is failing?
- What have you tried?
- What does error say?

Get complete picture before suggesting solutions.

### Debug Together
Don't just tell answer:
- Work through problem together
- Show debugging process
- Explain reasoning
- Teach debugging skills

### Start with Simplest Explanations
Check obvious things first:
- Typos
- Missing imports
- Syntax errors
- Wrong variable names

Before jumping to complex theories.

### Use Existing Resources
Point to documentation:
- "Check PATTERNS.md section 3.2"
- "Look at similar function in module X"
- "This is documented in library Y docs"

Help developer learn to find answers.

### Explain Why
Don't just fix, explain:
- Why it wasn't working
- Why solution works
- How to avoid in future
- What to learn from this

### Know When to Escalate
Some problems aren't implementation issues:
- Test is wrong â†’ Test Reviewer
- Spec is unclear â†’ Spec Writer
- Architecture needs change â†’ Platform Lead
- Pattern is bad â†’ Platform Lead

Don't try to solve everything yourself.

### Document Patterns
If same issue comes up repeatedly:
- Note for PATTERNS.md update
- Note for RULES.md if it's forbidden
- Note for BUG_LEDGER if it's a mistake

### Be Patient
Developer is stuck and may be frustrated:
- Stay calm and supportive
- Break problem down
- Celebrate progress
- Acknowledge difficulty

## Common Pitfalls

### Just Giving Answers
**Problem**: Telling solution without explaining.

**Solution**: Debug together. Explain reasoning. Teach debugging process.

### Assuming Problem
**Problem**: Jumping to solution without understanding issue.

**Solution**: Ask questions first. Verify problem. Check assumptions.

### Ignoring Context
**Problem**: Suggesting solution that violates project patterns.

**Solution**: Check SYSTEM_MAP, PATTERNS, RULES. Suggest solutions that fit project.

### Not Checking Documentation
**Problem**: Debugging from scratch without checking existing resources.

**Solution**: Always check spec, tests, patterns, similar code first.

### Fixing Instead of Advising
**Problem**: Writing code for developer instead of guiding them.

**Solution**: Suggest approach, let them implement. You're advisor, not implementer.

### Not Following Up
**Problem**: Suggesting solution and disappearing.

**Solution**: Check if it worked. Answer follow-up questions. Verify problem is solved.

## Examples

### Example 1: Import Error

**Developer**: "I'm getting ImportError: cannot import name 'validate_email' from 'src.utils.validation'. The file exists and the function is there. What's wrong?"

**Advisor**: "Let me ask a few questions to understand:
1. Can you show me the exact import statement you're using?
2. What's the current working directory when running tests?
3. Is there an `__init__.py` file in src/utils/?

[Developer provides info]

Okay, I see the issue. Your import statement is:
```python
from src.utils.validation import validate_email
```

But looking at the project structure, the tests run from the project root, and the module path should include your project name. Based on SYSTEM_MAP.md, the correct import is:
```python
from src.utils.validation import validate_email
```

But also check: Does src/utils/ have an `__init__.py` file? If not, Python won't recognize it as a package. Create an empty `src/utils/__init__.py` file.

Let me know if that fixes it, and I can help with any follow-up issues."

### Example 2: Test Failure Mystery

**Developer**: "Test is failing but I don't understand why. Test expects (True, None) but getting (False, 'Email cannot be empty'). But I'm passing a valid email!"

**Advisor**: "Okay, let's debug this together. Can you share:
1. The test code that's failing
2. The exact email you're passing
3. The implementation code

[Developer shares]

Ah, I see it! Look at your test:
```python
email = "user@example.com "  # Note the trailing space!
```

There's a trailing space in the test email. Your implementation has:
```python
if not email or email.isspace():
    return False, "Email cannot be empty"
```

The `email.isspace()` check returns False (the whole string isn't whitespace), but you probably want to strip the email first or check differently.

Looking at the spec section 2.2, it says 'whitespace-only emails should be rejected'. But your test has a space at the *end*, not a whitespace-only string.

Two options:
1. Strip whitespace: `email = email.strip()` at start of function
2. Check if spec intended this behavior

What does the spec say about trailing whitespace? Should 'user@example.com ' be valid or invalid?

Let's check spec section 2.2 together..."

### Example 3: Architectural Confusion

**Developer**: "I need to get user data for the export feature. Can I import from `src.database.models.User` directly?"

**Advisor**: "Good question! Let me check the project architecture rules...

Looking at RULES.md section 3.2: 'Export layer must not import database models directly. Use service layer.'

So no, you shouldn't import User model directly. Instead, use:
```python
from src.services.user_service import get_user
```

The reason (per RULES.md) is separation of concerns - export layer handles formatting, service layer handles data fetching. This makes code more testable and maintainable.

Looking at SYSTEM_MAP.md, the export module (`src/exports/`) should only depend on the service layer, not the database layer.

For your specific case, you probably want `user_service.get_user(user_id)` which returns a dict with user data. Check out `src/exports/activity.py` - it shows a similar pattern for exporting activities.

Does that help clarify the architecture?"

### Example 4: Performance Issue

**Developer**: "My export function works but takes 30 seconds for a user with 10k activities. Too slow. How do I speed it up?"

**Advisor**: "30 seconds is indeed too slow. Let's debug this. Can you share the export code?

[Developer shares code]

I see the issue! You're doing:
```python
for activity in activities:
    user = get_user(activity.user_id)  # Problem!
    # ... format activity
```

This is the classic N+1 query problem. For 10k activities, you're making 10k user lookups!

But wait - all activities belong to the same user (you're exporting one user's data). So you only need one user lookup:
```python
user = get_user(user_id)  # Once, before loop
for activity in activities:
    # ... format activity using user data
```

Try that and let me know if it's faster. Should drop from 30 seconds to under 1 second.

Also, for future reference, this pattern is documented in PATTERNS.md section 4.5 'Avoid N+1 queries'. Worth reading!"

### Example 5: Library API Confusion

**Developer**: "I'm trying to use the CSV library but my test expects specific quote escaping and I can't figure out how to make csv.DictWriter do it."

**Advisor**: "CSV escaping can be tricky. Before we dive into csv.DictWriter, let me check something...

Looking at PATTERNS.md section 5.3 'CSV Export', there's already a blessed utility for this:
```python
from src.utils.csv_helpers import dict_to_csv
```

This handles RFC 4180 escaping (including quote handling) and is used across all exports in the project. It was created specifically because of Bug #127 where manual CSV escaping was done incorrectly.

Instead of using csv.DictWriter directly, try:
```python
from src.utils.csv_helpers import dict_to_csv

activities = [
    {"timestamp": act.timestamp, "action": act.action, ...}
    for act in activities
]
csv_output = dict_to_csv(activities)
```

The utility handles all the quote escaping per RFC 4180. Check out `src/exports/user_data.py` for a complete example of using it.

This is exactly the kind of thing PATTERNS.md is for - documenting blessed approaches so you don't have to figure out CSV escaping yourself. Always worth checking PATTERNS.md before implementing utilities!

Try the blessed utility and let me know if it solves your test issue."

## When to Deviate

### Minimal Advisor Role When:
- Experienced solo developer (you debug yourself mostly)
- Very simple project (few complex issues)
- Strong documentation (answers are in docs)

### Active Advisor Role When:
- Learning new technologies (more guidance needed)
- Complex domain (lots of uncertainty)
- Multiple team members (more people need help)
- Rapid development (less time to debug alone)

### Escalate Rather Than Advise When:
- Problem is actually a test bug (â†’ Test Reviewer)
- Problem is actually spec ambiguity (â†’ Spec Writer)
- Problem reveals architectural issue (â†’ Platform Lead)
- Problem is about process/workflow (â†’ Human/PM)

## Critical Reminders

**DO:**
- Ask clarifying questions
- Debug together, don't just solve
- Explain reasoning and teach
- Point to documentation
- Check existing resources first
- Follow up to verify solution worked
- Be patient and supportive

**DON'T:**
- Just give answers without explaining
- Assume you understand problem
- Write code for developer
- Ignore project patterns/architecture
- Try to solve everything (escalate when appropriate)
- Get frustrated with developer
- Forget to document recurring issues

The goal is unsticking development progress while teaching debugging skills and reinforcing project patterns.
