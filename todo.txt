# Workflow Meta-Project TODO

## CRITICAL - Documentation Quality

* Properly write 6 minimal schemas to comprehensive format:
  - schema-guidelines.md
  - schema-system-map.md
  - schema-review.md
  - schema-implementation-code.md
  - schema-interface-skeleton-code.md
  - schema-test-code.md
  Target: Match depth of vision/scope/roadmap/spec/bug-report schemas (500-1100 lines)

* Flesh out stub documentation files:
  - Ontology.md - Add introduction, context, organization, reading guidance
  - RoleCatalog.md - Add title, intro explaining layered structure
  - ConcreteProjectSetup.md - Currently just "This needs to be written"
  - ConcreteWorkflow.md - Currently just "To be written"

## HIGH PRIORITY - Workflow Process Gaps

* Add REFACTOR step to TDD cycle in role-implementer.md
  Currently: RED → GREEN
  Should be: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
  Include: refactoring checklist, when to refactor, when to skip

* Document feedback loop: Implementation → Planning
  Add "Checkpoint Review" process to workflow documentation
  Triggers: After Phase 1 complete, >50% features need spec changes, core assumption invalidated
  Process: Platform Lead identifies need, assemble findings, update Vision/Scope/Roadmap with version bump

* Spell out procedure when implementer requests test changes
  Tests are contract, but what if tests are wrong?
  Who approves test modifications?
  How to validate proposed changes don't weaken contract?

* Spell out how to update spec if issues discovered during:
  - Skeleton writing (structural problems)
  - Test writing (missing acceptance criteria)
  - Implementation (behavioral ambiguities)
  Process: Who can request changes? Who approves? Does spec need re-review?

* Add test coverage requirements to role-test-reviewer.md
  Coverage thresholds: >80% line, >70% branch
  Verification commands
  Edge case completeness checklist
  Exception coverage requirements

* Strengthen bug fix sentinel test verification
  Add to Implementation Reviewer checklist:
  - Verify sentinel test FAILS on old code
  - Verify sentinel test PASSES on new code
  - Test is specific to bug (not generic)
  Include verification commands

## MEDIUM PRIORITY - Workflow Design Questions

* Should we have schema for review requests?
  Currently: Reviews have schema, but not review requests
  Would formalize what reviewers need to do their job

* Are subdirectories of /reviews aligned with schema and role files?
  Check: vision/, scope/, roadmap/, specs/, skeletons/, tests/, implementations/
  vs role files and workflow stages

* Is the unit/integration/regression test directory division best?
  Alternative: contract/ (acceptance criteria tests) and sentinel/ (regression tests)
  Evaluate: Does current structure match how tests are actually written/used?

* Is who moves what and when consistent across all role files?
  Audit: Ensure state transitions match between:
  - LayoutAndState.md
  - Workflow.md ownership matrix
  - Individual role files

* Clarify milestone-to-phase mapping
  Vision has milestones (6mo/1yr/3yr)
  Roadmap has phases and weeks
  Add guidance: How do phases map to milestones? What if they don't fit?

* When do we flesh out roadmap items that were sketched?
  Just-in-time planning: When do Phase 2 features get detailed?
  Before Phase 1 done? During Phase 1? Only when starting Phase 2?

* Is there redundancy? Can we make this more concise?
  General optimization pass
  Look for duplicated information across files
  Opportunities to simplify without losing value

## AUTOMATION & TOOLING

* How do we orchestrate handoffs between roles?
  Currently: Manual - user switches CLI tools
  Options: Scripts? Workflow automation? Git hooks?
  Document current approach and future automation plans

* Should writers/implementers call reviewers automatically?
  Have MCP server example from previous project (Claude → Codex reviews)
  Expand to: Auto-trigger reviews when work complete?
  Referenced conversation with Claude chat - review and incorporate

* How to quickly infer project state from filesystem?
  Workflow captures state via directory structure
  Need: Quick status command or script
  Shows: What's in flight, what's next, what's blocked
  Design: State visualization tool/script

## NOTES & CLARIFICATIONS

* Living docs on feature branches - DECISION MADE
  REASON: Can't reference components that don't exist yet on main
  - SYSTEM_MAP.md: Must point to new components introduced on branch
  - GUIDELINES.md: Can reference new utilities introduced on branch
  TRADEOFF: Risk of merge conflicts if multiple branches edit same docs
  ACCEPTABLE: For serial feature development (initial target)
  NOTE: Add to documentation:
    "This workflow assumes primarily serial feature development. For parallel
    feature development (multiple active feature branches), living docs on
    branches may cause merge conflicts. Consider alternative strategies:
    - Living docs PRs separate from feature PRs
    - Serialize living doc updates (merge first branch touching docs before others)"

* AGENTS.md routing wording
  Current: Ambiguous about "official" vs "exploring" agents
  Need: Better wording to guide agents that have AGENTS.md as init file
  vs agents just poking around the project

## COMPLETED
✓ Fix typos in README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, Workflow.md, LayoutAndState.md
✓ Review documentation quality and structure
✓ Review workflow design and logic
✓ Map complete document network (zero orphans)
